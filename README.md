# Objective

- Learning the basics on how to use poetry.

# Personal notes
---
- What I liked the most about Poetry is the structure it brings onto projects. It's simple, yet powerful as well as likely effective when it comes to complex and large projects;
- Even tough you have the pyproject.toml file, since we're working with Streamlit, a requirements.txt is still necessary for Streamlit Cloud to properly understand the necessary dependencies in order to keep the app running.
